# OptionsDashboard
Using Ipywidgets and Plotly to build a dashboard and plot historical options prices.

Currently configured to read an Excel file off my local machine so needs to be modified for your source data.
Also utilizes Plotly, so requires a login for Plotly charts. Otherwise Pandas plotting capabilities is built in but commented out.
